Harry-Potter-1-PC-Fps-Fix

This is the Harry Potter 1 PC game FPS fix/ limiter

This Launcher simply patches the game using the internal logic to put a cap on fps to solve issues inside the game relating to fps being to high with no way to limit it.

Simply go to release and download the zip file and put hp1-60FPSLauncher.exe into the games install location next to hp.exe (Harry Potter 1 PC exe)

Use the launcher to run the game now instead of the hp.exe you can make a shortcut of the launcher on your desktop if you wish.
