# Requirements before using fix
IMPORTANT READ THE READ ME FILE INCLUDED WITH THE DOWNLOAD BEFORE USING THE FIX.

# Information on the fix
This launcher simply patches the game using the internal logic to put a 60fps cap on in order to solve issues inside of the game relating to fps being too high, as there is not a proper way to limit it.

# Instructions
Go to releases and download the latest version of the HP1-FPS-Cap-Game-Launcher.zip. Then extract the hp1-60FPSLauncher.exe into your games system folder next to the hp.exe file and you are good to go! 

You can now use the hp1-60FPSLauncher.exe file to run the game now instead of the normal hp.exe file. If you wish you can make a shortcut for the hp1-60FPSLauncher.exe on your desktop.
